### TODO
* Add https://github.com/GoogleChrome/web-vitals
* Add reporting performance to Google Analytics

#### Real Book
* Remove all look behind, they are not supported by mobile browsers
* Say nothing found if filter not empty
* Add playlists and better navigation with global state store and redux
* Handle too many chords in bar, decrease font size
* Encrypt song to data url for export
* Display repeat ending top borders properly, maybe SVG entire bar
* Render W symbol as a space (Butterfly), Coda, Segno and Fermata symbols (Always And Forever)
* Analyze chords and add option to present them as steps, build Markov Chain
* Check all songs after Armando's Rhumba

#### csound
* Integrate with real book
* Generate csd from chord progression

#### Metronome
* @svgdotjs/svg.js manipulates DOM so in react we have to use ref which becomes deprecated

#### Fluff
* Check out Bulma https://bulma.io/
* Check out https://svelte.dev/
