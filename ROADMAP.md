### TODO
* Add https://github.com/GoogleChrome/web-vitals
* Add reporting performance to Google Analytics

#### Map
* Rework, try highcharts, am4 charts are too heavy

#### Real Book
* Mobile Layout
* SVG chord bars Handle too many chords in bar, decrease font size, Display repeat ending top borders properly, maybe SVG entire bar
* Render W symbol as a space (Butterfly), Coda, Segno and Fermata symbols (Always And Forever)
* Add playlists and better navigation with global state store and redux
* Encrypt song to data url for export
* Analyze chords and add option to present them as steps, build Markov Chain
* Check all songs after Armando's Rhumba

#### csound
* Integrate with real book
* Generate csd from chord progression

#### Metronome
* @svgdotjs/svg.js manipulates DOM so in react we have to use ref which becomes deprecated

#### Fluff
