### TODO
* Add https://github.com/GoogleChrome/web-vitals
* Add reporting performance to Google Analytics

#### Real Book
* Add csound
* Add playlists and better navigation with global state store and redux
* Handle many chords in bar, decrease font size
* encrypt song to data url for export
* Display ending lines properly, maybe SVG entire bar
* Parse pauses in bar correctly, for example in Always And Forever
* Analyze chords and add option to present them as steps

#### Metronome
* @svgdotjs/svg.js manipulates DOM so in react we have to use ref which becomes deprecated

#### Fluff
* Check out Bulma https://bulma.io/
